# Climate-Change-and-Impacts-in-Africa

# Introduction

This project focuses on reporting the current state of climate change in Africa, along with its impact on various African regions. 

The primary goal is to analyze the IEA-EDGAR CO2 dataset, clean and combine the data, and generate valuable insights that will be presented in a comprehensive report.

# Background

Climate change refers to the long-term alteration of temperatures and weather patterns globally. 
While natural factors such as changes in solar activity and volcanic eruptions contribute to these shifts, human activities have become the predominant driver of climate change since the 19th century. 
The burning of fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and gas, has significantly contributed to the increase in greenhouse gas emissions, resulting in adverse consequences.

# Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:
Analyze the IEA-EDGAR CO2 dataset to understand emission trends and patterns.
Clean and combine data for accurate analysis.
Create a comprehensive report on the current state of climate change in Africa.
Provide insights on the impact of climate change on different African regions using case studies.

# Expected Outcomes

The project aims to achieve the following outcomes:
A clear understanding of current CO2 emission trends in Africa.
Insights into the impact of climate change on various African regions.
